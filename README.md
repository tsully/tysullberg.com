Hi! I build tools to humans find connection, autonomy, and purpose.

I've lived many lives - software engineer, management consultant, founder, community organizer, sangha member. My problem solving approach attempts to integrate and transcend these perspectives.

## Coordination technology

I'm co-founder of Ize, a platform for collective attention and action. You can think of it as "Zapier for collective intelligence". I built Ize as a solo-founder and engineer from Jan 2024 through March 2025.

- You can check out a demo [here](https://vimeo.com/1056860875)
- Read the postmortem [here](https://tysullberg.substack.com/p/collective-attention-as-a-service).

I'm currently working on a side-project for AI multi-agent deliberation and coordination. It's essentially Ize adapted for a purely agentic context. DM me if you're interested in collaboration :)

Prior to Ize, I built coordination tools for blockchain. I was VP of Product and Protocol for [4K](https://4k.com/), a protocol for on-chain assets. 4K was a purely decentralized on-chain alternative to the legal system for enforcing physical property rights.

I'm a contributor at several collective intelligence research groups including [Metagov](https://metagov.org/), [DAOStar](https://daostar.org/), [Active Inference Institute](https://www.activeinference.institute/), and [Sensemaking Scenius](https://kpaxle.mmm.page/scenius).

## Community organizing

The most effective coordination technologies are human culture and relationships. I've helped build several community organizations:

- **Cofounder of The Conscious Club**: Creating community via meditation + rave
- **Cofounder of Open Sangha Collective**: A grassroots organization removing capitalism from Western Buddhist sangha.
- **Mutual aid**: I'm Currently working on building a Mutual Aid Network here in Portland.

## Dhamma / meditation

Actually, I take that back - the most effective coordination technology is mind. I write about the relationship between dhamma and collective intelligence in my [Substack](https://tysullberg.substack.com/).

Meditation is a big part of my life. I started with Mahasi-style Vipassana back in 2018 before moving to TWIM. My practices these days is oriented around Mahamudra.
